00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.922
<i>My parents
say there's no such thing as a bad day.</i>

2
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.361
<i>That it's all how you look at it.</i>

3
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.886
<i>What can I tell you? Parents.</i>

4
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.320
<i>Here is what I know.</i>

5
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.803
<i>They're wrong.</i>

6
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.169
<i>My name is Alexander,
and I'm the expert in bad days.</i>

7
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.330
<i>This guy knows what I'm talking about.
That's not coming off.</i>

8
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.246
<i>Did I mention my dad
is a relentless optimist?</i>

9
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.606
We're in the home stretch.

10
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.641
<i>And look at Mom.</i>

11
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.451
<i>She's not fooling anyone
with that "Mom smile."</i>

12
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810
<i>Believe it or not,
by the time we got home...</i>

13
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.161
<i>this van was in better
shape than we were.</i>

14
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.087
<i>There's my sister Emily, the actress.</i>

15
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.091
<i>Always ready to take a bow.</i>

16
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.371
<i>Anthony, my brother, a total winner
with a great sense of style.</i>

17
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.130
<i>And baby Trevor.</i>

18
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.682
<i>Sorry, pal.
Definitely not coming off.</i>

19
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.368
<i>Bottom line, today was an epic disaster.
The worst day possible.</i>

20
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.647
<i>Everyone in my family would agree.</i>

21
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.002
<i>But what they don't know,
is it was all my fault.</i>

22
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.963
<i>And it wasn't over yet.</i>

23
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.570
You overslept, bud.

24
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.965
Don't blow my didgeridoo!

25
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.008
What's it for, then?

26
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.922
<i>You're invited!
Philip Parker turning 12.</i>

27
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.081
Tomorrow night?

28
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.771
No!

29
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.450
He's the trick to... Good morning!

30
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.329
Oh! There she is!

31
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.290
You are going to be so impressed.

32
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.283
I made what is known as...

33
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.284
the crustless quiche, the frittata.

34
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.765
Wow. What is this?

35
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.446
Two months ago, you couldn't even
grill cheese, and now...

36
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.682
Oh, that looks so good.

37
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.684
- Oh.
- Mmm. Egg and cheese.

38
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.966
Excellent.

39
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.286
Thank you.

40
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.846
So, what are you gentlemen up to today?

41
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.921
Well, let's see.

42
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.167
Em has a dentist appointment
this morning...

43
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.287
Right, right.

44
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.721
And then the two of us
are going to Mommy and Me Yoga.

45
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.211
- Oh, with Summer?
- Yes.

46
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.566
Will you tell her I still exist?

47
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.086
I will. And then when he takes his nap,

48
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.645
I'm gonna send out some resumes.

49
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.801
Good.

50
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.406
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

51
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.482
A thing distinctly hard to say
but harder still to do.

52
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.251
We'll beat a tattoo at a minute or two
and a rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tattoo...

53
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.481
and the dragon will come
to the beat of the drum

54
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.646
at a minute or two to two today...

55
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.801
at a minute or two to two.

56
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.649
- I need to pee.
- You have gum in your hair.

57
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.762
A big black bug bit a big black bear...

58
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.961
No!

59
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.007
Anthony! Alexander!
Accelerate. Come on!

60
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.405
One minute!

61
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.889
Hey, if it ain't broke, right?

62
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.441
Guess what?

63
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.251
Philip Parker's having
his birthday party tomorrow night.

64
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.361
That's when
you're having your birthday party.

65
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.368
I know! And I just got the invitation.

66
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.164
He's going all-out, Dad.

67
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.004
He's getting an energy drink bar,

68
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.606
a Korean taco truck, a live band.

69
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.681
That sounds legit.

70
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.802
I think he's having black lights
and a karaoke machine.

71
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.046
Oh, I love karaoke parties.

72
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.089
Look, can I compete with all of that?

73
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.887
Oh, come on,
your birthday's gonna be great.

74
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.282
It's gonna be fun. We're gonna have
pizza. I'm gonna make a cake.

75
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.124
Maybe some volleyball in the pool.

76
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.851
Philip Parker's having a fog machine
and we're having pizza?

77
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.325
- Don't worry.
- You're drinking coffee?

78
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.361
What about my party?

79
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.487
Since when did
you start drinking coffee?

80
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.851
I'm not a morning person.

81
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.929
- Can you check his diaper?
- Oh.

82
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.206
You just dropped Bumble Bee.

83
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.160
- You drop Bumble Bee?
- I think he might be wet.

84
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.168
No. Bumble Bee. There you go.

85
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.280
Wish I could be there, bro,

86
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.566
but I got prom tomorrow night.

87
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.761
I thought that was next week.

88
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.841
It is what it is.

89
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.201
I'll probably be wiped out
from my <i>Peter</i> Pan premiere...

90
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.844
but I'll be happy to sing for you
and all of your friends.

91
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.881
Oh! No, no, no.

92
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.961
<i>Think of</i> a wonderful thought...

93
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.566
Oh, probably Mrs. Gibson. Okay.

94
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.730
Honey, Dad's taking Emily to the dentist.

95
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.330
I've got Anthony. So you're in carpool.

96
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.721
- Take a frittata. It's a crustless quiche.
- There you go.

97
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.171
What did you do to your hair?

98
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.480
Oh, nothing.

99
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.564
Say hi to Mrs. Gibson!
Remember your manners.

100
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.689
Hi, Becky!

101
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.684
Hey, Alexander.

102
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.610
Oh, are you okay?

103
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.204
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.361
Let's go, kids.

105
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.923
<i>And so I cry sometimes
when I'm lying in bed</i>

106
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.601
<i>Just to get it all out, what's in my head</i>

107
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.481
<i>And I, I am feeling a little peculiar...</i>

108
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.889
<i>Lord of the Flies?</i>

109
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.450
Pretty scary, right?

110
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.846
<i>Lord of the Flies is beautiful, Alexander.</i>

111
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.445
It's a deep and meaningful allegory

112
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.488
about our own messed-up society.

113
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.601
Yeah, totally.

114
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.404
That's what I meant with "scary."

115
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.131
The society stuff. Crazy.

116
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.803
Hey, check out this app.

117
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.326
He puts your face on
some bikini model's body.

118
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.930
It's really gross and sexist.

119
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.291
This is gonna be hilarious.

120
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.810
- What are you doing?
- Wait, hold on!

121
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.000
- No, no, no.
- I'm not done.

122
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.321
Hey, babe.

123
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.440
Is everything okay?
Your last text was so cold.

124
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.531
No, I said, "See you at school"?

125
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.688
Yeah. I'm your girlfriend, Anthony.

126
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.282
You really should end your texts
with "x-o-x-o" or "I heart you."

127
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.688
You can make a heart
with the less-than sign and a three.

128
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.848
Yeah, I'll try to remember.

129
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.123
So, a bunch of the girls were talking,
and they're all going in limos.

130
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.128
We are getting a limo tomorrow, right?

131
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.640
No, I am taking
my driver's test tomorrow, babe.

132
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.489
The first thing I wanna
do as a licensed driver

133
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.363
is chauffeur you to the prom.

134
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.209
It'll be romantic and stuff.

135
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.161
Oh. Well, I do want it to be romantic.

136
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.440
It Will be.

137
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.207
Oh. Also, I have it
from a very good source who says...

138
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.850
we're being crowned Duke and Duchess

139
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.689
at the Royal Court
tomorrow night at prom.

140
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.200
- That's so tight!
- I know. Isn't it like the best thing ever?

141
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.522
This is
the worst thing ever.

142
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.971
These look so real.

143
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.725
I can't believe
Elliot text-bombed the whole school.

144
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.802
Don't worry about it, man.
Elliot's an idiot.

145
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.405
No one's even gonna look at these.

146
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.120
Hey, Paul.

147
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.406
Philip, my man.

148
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.805
Nice boobs, Alexander.

149
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.649
Since when are you friends
with Philip Parker?

150
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.768
We go to the same
psychopharmacologist.

151
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.844
He's got ADHD, too. He's super nice.

152
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.881
No, he's not.

153
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.169
He's throwing a huge party tomorrow,
and it's not even his actual birthday.

154
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.924
His is next week.

155
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.287
You realize it's just gonna
be you and me at my party.

156
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.681
- Actually, it might just be you.
- What?

157
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.684
You've gotta come.
You're my best friend.

158
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.890
Okay, but personally,
I think you should just postpone.

159
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.605
Philip's popular
and everybody's gonna be there.

160
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.130
Plus, his party sounds pretty dope.

161
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.680
Dude, last year
your dad tap-danced with a cane.

162
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.328
Another bad party could
ruin your rep forever.

163
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.843
Your dad's a nice guy, but trust me...

164
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.127
you do not want
your entire social life in his hands.

165
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.366
Whoo!

166
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.680
Great job!

167
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.524
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

168
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.809
Breathe. You gave birth.
You can do this.

169
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.281
Two. One.

170
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.604
Take your baby back to the womb.
They love it there.

171
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.966
I think that it's so cool when a guy can
step up to be a full-time fommy.

172
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.601
A what?

173
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.121
A father-mommy.

174
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.964
Oh! Okay.

175
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.646
Um, yeah,
I guess I'm sort of a fommy by default.

176
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.443
I was in aerospace,
and I got transitioned out of my job.

177
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.527
Oh, I'm sorry.

178
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.080
No, that's okay. I get to spend
more time with this little guy.

179
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.641
Excuse me.

180
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.164
Hello?

181
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.850
Yes, this is Ben Cooper.

182
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.404
Tomorrow?

183
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.925
Yes, that's good.

184
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.529
Okay, I'll see you then.

185
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.443
I look forward to it, Greg. Bye-bye.

186
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.080
Good news?

187
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.050
Yeah! I landed an interview.

188
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.485
Hey! That's great.

189
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.166
What do you think of that?
What do you think of that?

190
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.244
Fommy just landed an interview.

191
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.446
Fommy.

192
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.161
Did you hear him say that?

193
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.241
Yes!

194
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.446
He just said Fommy!

195
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.323
- You just said my name!
- Aw!

196
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.051
Guys, he just said Fommy.
Did you hear him say Fommy?

197
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.326
I'm Fommy. Fommy!

198
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.646
That was so cool.

199
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.842
It's so adorable!

200
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.161
I am Fommy, and he said it.

201
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.322
So, with our celebrity readings,

202
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.442
our great grassroots
marketing campaign...

203
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.567
Thank you, Julie...

204
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.404
and the positive reviews
we have coming in...

205
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.882
we are poised for a really strong roll-out.

206
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.440
Tomorrow, we are
going to ask America...

207
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.727
"Who is ready to jump on the potty?"

208
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.124
And I'm confident our sales are going
to leap over expectations.

209
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.804
I know I would have
appreciated this book

210
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.882
when I was potty-training my kids!

211
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.331
That's Alexander, my son.

212
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.806
Thank you, guys!

213
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.962
Thank you for all your support with this.

214
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.889
Oh, man.

215
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.008
I hope that was
thorough enough for you, Nina.

216
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.202
Well, I'm going to need you to make

217
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.521
an incredible effort
on "the Potty" tomorrow.

218
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.005
On "the Potty."

219
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.486
- What?
- You can count on me.

220
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.281
Good. Because if this goes well,
I'm going to make you VP.

221
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.407
Really?

222
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.488
Have you run
Children's Lit and Young Adult.

223
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.210
Oh! Thank you!

224
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.526
Thank you.

225
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.169
I'm going to need you

226
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.641
every second of every minute
of every day.

227
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.927
- Got it.
- 24/7, 365.

228
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.246
That's a lot of numbers.

229
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.321
Is that a joke?

230
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.247
I have four kids that I'll just have
to carve out a little time to see.

231
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.965
Right, right, of course.
Of course you will.

232
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.042
Isn't that one of
your darling little babies right there?

233
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.161
Yeah, it is.

234
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.042
So you're seeing him right now.

235
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.605
All right, country reports.

236
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.042
As you all know,
this is your big project this semester.

237
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.320
- So, what I think...
- Mr. Rogue?

238
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.925
Yeah, Alexander.

239
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.445
I would like to take Australia.

240
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.443
I know a ton about it.

241
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.482
And I have my own didgeridoo.

242
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.804
Yeah, I'm sure there a lot of students
here who want Australia. Am I right?

243
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.081
So to be fair, this semester...

244
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.290
I'm going to let the globe
decide what country.

245
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.441
We'll start with you, Alexander.

246
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.806
You ready? Here we go.

247
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.446
Australia. Australia. Australia.

248
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.931
What will it be?

249
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.209
Ha! Djibouti.

250
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.602
Look at that, the Horn of Africa!
All right, Djibouti!

251
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.846
Dji... what?

252
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.844
Who's gonna be next here?
Philip Parker. Here we go.

253
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.681
Australia.

254
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.808
So, like,
Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff?

255
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.325
That's Austria, not Australia.

256
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.805
- Can we switch?
- No.

257
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.922
Okay, Albert Morio.

258
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.282
Lebanon. That's good.

259
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.806
Partner up,
everybody! Get your aprons on. Guys.

260
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.681
Uh, Becky...

261
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.643
do you want to partner?

262
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.604
Okay. You can take lab notes.

263
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.728
.5 milligrams of boron.

264
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.331
Boron... Boring!

265
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.446
So, Becky, I'm having
a birthday party tomorrow night.

266
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.561
It was only gonna be guys, but I can...

267
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.008
Oh, thanks, but I'm going
to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.

268
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.849
I think everyone is.

269
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.526
He has a frozen yogurt machine
and a trampoline.

270
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.609
So do we!

271
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.331
We have a frozen yogurt machine
and a trampoline.

272
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.450
- Oh, my God!
- Well, yeah...

273
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.726
My lab book!

274
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.848
Put it out!

275
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.921
Put it out!

276
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.925
Who's responsible for this?

277
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.081
Alexander!

278
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.924
Hey, Alexander! Hold up.

279
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.650
Hey, hold up!

280
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.609
I'm leaving for a conference

281
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.762
and nobody signed up
to take Melvin home.

282
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.683
I can't leave him alone all weekend.

283
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.050
So, what do you want me to do?

284
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.084
Well, you'll make
a furry friend a little less lonely.

285
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.811
Unbelievable.

286
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.327
Cool, we're hosting a guinea pig.

287
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.481
All right!

288
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.401
Sorry we're late.

289
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.442
We had a little
diaper trauma at Trader Joe's.

290
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.601
Hello!

291
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.210
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.

292
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.282
There's my big boy. Hi!

293
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.163
There you are. Hi, big guy.

294
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.124
- What is that?
- Melvin.

295
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.281
We're hosting
Melvin this weekend.

296
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.361
Oh, boy.

297
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.122
Alexander, would you grab that
and wash it off, please?

298
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.123
He needs Bumble Bee like he needs air.

299
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.201
I know, honey pie.

300
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.567
And after that, the pig goes upstairs.

301
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.801
Shh, it's okay.

302
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.804
Bumble Bee's
just getting a bath. It will be right back.

303
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.207
Alexander, we could use Bumble Bee.

304
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.287
Bumble Bee is coming right back,
right back, right back any second.

305
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.401
Oh! Dad, don't!

306
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.521
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

307
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.524
What was that?

308
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.009
Honey, Bumble Bee's gone.

309
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.243
<i>Peter</i> Pan is going to be awesome.

310
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.689
Today, Mr. Brand said that I am the most
poised and elegant Peter Pan...

311
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.324
he's ever had
the privilege of working with.

312
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.250
No way! Wow.
When is that, again? Just remind me.

313
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.011
- Mom, hello! It's tomorrow afternoon!
- Of course.

314
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.088
Please be on time
and don't be embarrassing.

315
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.247
Best behavior.

316
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.890
Honey, please don't
embarrass our daughter.

317
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.485
- Dad, that includes you.
- I know.

318
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.090
I'll be there, honey, don't worry.

319
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.049
Guess who's getting
crowned Duke at the prom tomorrow.

320
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.690
Really? Congratulations.

321
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.207
Yeah, it's not official,
but Celia heard from a good source.

322
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.406
It's kind of crazy.

323
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.289
I'm dating the hottest girl in school...

324
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.442
I'm getting crowned at prom,
and once I get my license tomorrow...

325
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.364
I kind of have
everything I've ever wanted.

326
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.528
- Hashtag blessed, you know.
- Wait.

327
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.608
Once you get your license tomorrow?

328
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.045
I'm taking my test after school.

329
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.167
Dad already said it was cool.

330
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.326
You said it was cool?

331
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.045
I said it was doable.
Not cool. I said it was doable.

332
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.246
Okay.

333
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.049
It will be fine. We'll make it.

334
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.531
Okay, guys, I have some news.

335
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.243
Nina said that
if the book launch goes well tomorrow...

336
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.045
you could be looking at the new
Vice President of Lone Hill Press.

337
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.161
Honey, wow!

338
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.881
That's big.

339
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.088
Yeah, it would
be a lot more hours at work...

340
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.408
I already feel like I live there some days,
but the raise would be nice.

341
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.761
Awesome. I have some news as well.

342
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.281
I got a call today. I have an interview
for a game design firm.

343
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.646
They're looking for engineers.

344
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.484
- Wait, video games? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.927
Your aerospace engineering dad
might be designing video games.

346
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.764
- That's so cool.
- I know. I know.

347
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.171
Oh!

348
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.403
The best news of all...
Guess who spoke his first word today?

349
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.521
Trevor.

350
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.840
- No!
- Yes.

351
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.921
What did you say?

352
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.405
What was it?

353
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.805
He said fommy.

354
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.291
- He said fommy?
- Yeah.

355
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.243
- What's that?
- Father-mommy.

356
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.484
I didn't know that was a word.

357
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.562
Wow,
we all had pretty big wins today.

358
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.045
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

359
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.167
I had a crap day.

360
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.129
What is that smell?

361
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.721
It's Vegemite.
It's from Australia, and back off!

362
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.761
Hey, hey, hey!

363
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.444
Easy. You're gonna have
a good day tomorrow.

364
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.324
It's your birthday. You have friends
coming over, it's gonna be a great party.

365
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.449
Actually, you can forget it,
because I'm canceling my party.

366
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.970
- What are you talking about?
- Why?

367
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.246
Nobody's coming.

368
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.961
They're all going
to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.

369
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.206
Who is this Philip Parker?

370
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.409
He's a really cool kid
with a hot tub and ADHD.

371
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.488
- I'm gonna call his mom...
- No!

372
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.609
No, no, no.
We're gonna forget about Philip Parker.

373
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.927
Whoever comes to the party comes.
It's gonna be great.

374
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.803
Trust me, nobody is coming.

375
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.521
Elliot Gibson texted pictures of me
in a butt thong to everyone at school.

376
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.365
My best friend
is suddenly best friends with Philip...

377
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.205
because they go to the same
dumb psychopharmacologist.

378
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.089
I didn't get Australia
for my school report...

379
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.562
and I burned down the science lab
with Becky Gibson's lab notes.

380
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.007
- What did you do?
- You burned down the science lab?

381
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.003
Dude, big deal.
So things didn't go your way today.

382
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.491
Go my way?

383
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.045
It was a totally wrecked bad day.

384
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.246
And it's not just today!

385
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.928
It is every single day. Every day!

386
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.970
You don't even care
because your lives are all so perfect!

387
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.365
No, we care. We care, honey.

388
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.249
- What?
- Sweetie.

389
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.440
Where's Bumble Bee?

390
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.729
Alexander murdered it,
so now he's going to cry all night.

391
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.211
- Can't you just get him a new one?
- No.

392
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.203
It's only Bumble Bee.
It's the only one he likes.

393
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.401
It's gotta be Bumble Bee.

394
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.561
I can't deal with this.

395
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.165
I'm going to rehearse in the car.

396
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.725
Maybe this is the time
to wean him from the pacifier.

397
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.006
Honey, easy for you to say.

398
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.530
You're not here with him all day.

399
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.765
<i>Think of</i> a <i>wonderful thought
Any merry little thought</i>

400
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.569
<i>Think of Christmas, think of snow</i>

401
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.369
<i>Think of sleigh bells, off you go</i>

402
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.488
<i>Like reindeer in the sky</i>

403
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.684
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

404
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.161
Anthony?

405
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.328
I feel like no one understands me.

406
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.531
I do. l get you.

407
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.331
You do?

408
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.611
Yeah. Come on, you're amazing.

409
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.721
Really?

410
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.641
You think I'm amazing?

411
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.042
Honestly, I love you so much.

412
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.769
I love you, too.

413
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.371
I love you more.

414
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.881
No, I love you more.

415
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.651
And don't get me started
on that cute little butt of yours.

416
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.881
What?

417
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.921
What?

418
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.161
Why are you "what" -ing me?

419
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.446
What's your problem?

420
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.208
<i>- Excuse me'?
- You know what? You're so annoying.</i>

421
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.040
Why can't you just chill out?
For one second?

422
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.806
You're exhausting.

423
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.041
Are you kidding?

424
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.602
Sorry, Celia. That was my idiot brother.

425
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.611
Celia?

426
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.931
Seriously?

427
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.090
Now she won't pick up!

428
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.443
I'm worried about Alexander.

429
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.723
I mean, of all the years for
everyone to bail on his birthday.

430
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.641
He's been so moody
since I had Trevor and started work.

431
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.284
Don't worry about it. He's 12.

432
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.685
Everybody's moody at that age.

433
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.966
How's he already 12?

434
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.849
I know. Just happened.

435
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.489
That's the problem.
Everything is just happening so fast.

436
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.521
Yeah.

437
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.647
This house is like a train station.

438
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.245
Everyone's coming and going...

439
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.602
and Trevor's first word was "Fommy."

440
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.724
- Maybe I misheard that.
- I don't think you did.

441
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.801
Honey, come on.

442
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.963
I got the kids covered.
I got the house covered.

443
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.004
You're killing it at work.

444
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.209
Things have never been better.

445
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.601
Oh, please.

446
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.960
- Never been better?
- It's true.

447
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.001
Ben...

448
00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.842
you've been unemployed
for the past seven months.

449
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.525
Aren't you stressed out?

450
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.766
Yeah. A little bit.

451
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.204
Why aren't you freaking out more?

452
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.843
What good would freaking out do?

453
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.167
Then I'd just be freaked out
and unemployed.

454
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.850
Tomorrow I'm gonna nail that interview.

455
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.526
Big day tomorrow.

456
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.370
It's 12:01, Melvin.

457
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.806
It's my birthday.

458
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.404
You ever feel alone in the world?

459
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.203
I just wish they understood!

460
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.882
I just wish they knew what it felt like...

461
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.884
to have a terrible, horrible,
no good, very bad day!

462
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.285
Shouldn't you guys be up?

463
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.001
Who hit snooze?

464
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.167
- What time is it?
- Who hit snooze?

465
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.083
- It's morning. It's morning.
- Okay, okay. Go, go, go.

466
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.120
- I have to take a shower.
- All right. Okay, okay.

467
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.764
All right, okay. All right.

468
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.444
Does anyone know
where the diapers are?

469
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.281
I'm in here!

470
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.921
Hey, honey?

471
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.361
Wow! You look terrible. Are you okay?

472
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.171
No, I'm not okay.
Peter Pan can't have a cold, Dad.

473
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.521
Okay.

474
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.961
Oh, come...

475
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.121
Harsh.

476
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.243
Bro, I gotta take a shower. I gotta
get to school. Celia won't call me back.

477
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.008
No! No way, not today!

478
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.326
Get out, dude.

479
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.407
Get out!

480
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.608
Why today?
This is the worst day! No!

481
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.890
I am so late. Emily?

482
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.644
I'm coming in for a razor, honey.

483
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.364
- Mom!
- Mom!

484
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.771
Mom, get out!

485
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.841
I'm sorry!

486
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.884
Sorry. Sorry. I'll wear pants!

487
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.569
Mother!

488
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.684
- Good morning.
- Speak for yourself.

489
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.365
Oh.

490
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.526
- Dad?
- Yeah!

491
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.285
Trevor's peeing! Where's his diaper?

492
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.441
I'm looking!

493
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.881
Oh!

494
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.804
Hey! There's the birthday boy.

495
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.841
Okay, come here.

496
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.169
Okay, you know what?
I want you to have a great day.

497
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.248
You are the captain of your ship.

498
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.322
Steer your ship with positivity.

499
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.601
Oh! Come on!

500
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.529
What is wrong with you people?

501
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.561
Anthony!

502
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.761
Dad, are you okay?

503
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.251
Look, you're older already.

504
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.608
I'm sorry, honey, I have to run.
I have a huge event...

505
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.091
and my foot is killing me.
I'm already late.

506
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.366
Ben, put a diaper on it.

507
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.566
We'll celebrate tonight, okay?

508
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.601
I'm trying.

509
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.928
Emily!

510
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.562
Emily? Emily!

511
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.809
You left the light on in my car all night.

512
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.881
The battery's dead.

513
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.082
I'm the one who had to rehearse
in a cold car, and now I'm sick!

514
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.241
Peter Pan!

515
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.203
- What happened to your head?
- Ben, we gotta go!

516
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.401
It's a zit. Is it that bad?

517
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.566
You should put a Band-Aid on that.

518
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.604
Ben! We have got to go!
You are my ride. Let's go, people.

519
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.251
Alexander, into the car.
We have got to go!

520
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.647
Everybody, out of the house!
Broom it out!

521
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.521
Get out of your comfort zone.
Push it. Push it.

522
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.409
You miss Bumble Bee, don't you?

523
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.601
Why is Anthony driving?

524
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.926
I feel sick enough as it is.

525
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.325
I need practice for my driver's test today.

526
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.562
Okay! Then can we at least
change the music, please?

527
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.364
That's good. Leave that!

528
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.408
You like that? Yeah! That's good.

529
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.885
Wonderful.

530
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.086
I can't believe I'm sick.

531
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.249
I cannot believe that
this guy is 12 years old.

532
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.281
Thanks, Dad.

533
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.243
This is not gonna work for me.

534
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.363
You're gonna have to get around there,
make a left on Brookwood.

535
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.249
- There's no room.
- Get aggressive!

536
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.123
We have places to be.
You're doing great.

537
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.162
Mom, do you mind? Please.

538
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.844
What? Because of this morning?

539
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.128
It's not the first time
I've seen your penis, Anthony!

540
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.128
- Mom saw your penis?
- Yep!

541
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.760
I've seen yours too, Alexander.

542
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.160
I've seen every penis in this car!

543
00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.481
Every penis.

544
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.080
Come on!

545
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.651
Excuse me, sir!

546
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.924
Excuse me, sir,
in the ironic Mini Cooper!

547
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.889
You're gonna have
to put down the latte...

548
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.128
and move or I am gonna
come and do it for you!

549
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.447
Sir, I am gonna come... Thank you, son.

550
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.646
Easy, hon.

551
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.284
Nice and slow. Nice and slow, sweets.

552
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.924
Gently, gently.

553
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.001
There you go, honey.

554
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.531
Move, move, move.

555
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.721
Go, go, go.

556
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.131
It's okay, baby.

557
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.764
Mom's gotta go. Have a good day.

558
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.080
Do you have lunch money?

559
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.446
- Yes?
- Got it.

560
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.521
Love you.

561
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.641
Mom!

562
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.129
This is not gonna work.
This is not gonna work!

563
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.044
Let's go! Fold in.
Woodwinds, make a window!

564
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.043
Come on! Let's go, kids!

565
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.162
The bell is ringing! Go, march, march!

566
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.365
Move it on in there. Fold in. Hustle!

567
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.001
Excuse me! Excuse me! Okay, come on!

568
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.729
This day is so cursed.

569
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.721
Everybody move out of the way.

570
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.320
Just move out of the way.
Make a window!

571
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.805
- Go. Here.
- All right.

572
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.769
Goodbye. Take your stuff.

573
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.564
Have a good day, honey!

574
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.641
Here we go, boys.

575
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.931
Celia!

576
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.650
Celia, wait up! What's wrong?

577
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.529
You haven't answered your phone
since last night.

578
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.484
Why do you care?
I thought I was so exhausting.

579
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.846
I wasn't talking to you.

580
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.405
I was talking to my idiot brother.

581
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.960
- Whatever.
- I tried calling you back!

582
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.082
I really didn't feel like talking to you.

583
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.003
I just don't think you understand...

584
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.924
the emotional responsibilities
that come from having a girlfriend.

585
00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.445
Wait, are you breaking up with me?

586
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.771
What about tonight?

587
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.446
I don't even wanna go.

588
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.166
Sorry. Morning!

589
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.241
Good morning!

590
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.245
Try calling again!

591
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.169
Sorry I'm late. I had a little car trouble.

592
00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.765
My husband had to drop me off.

593
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.923
- What happened?
- This happened!

594
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.647
And not just the cover. No.

595
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.610
15 times throughout the book.

596
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.291
But it must be
some horrible mistake at the printer!

597
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.529
I don't know, Cooper.
You're the one who did the final proof!

598
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.443
We can't have that in a children's book!

599
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.683
We just pulled the plug on publication.
So, that's good.

600
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.849
But we have an even bigger problem.

601
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.127
Celebrity readings. Dick Van Dyke!

602
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.400
I've been calling all morning,
but I can't get through.

603
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.566
Oh no.

604
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.642
I will get down there.
I will fix this. I will take care of this!

605
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.364
He won't read it.

606
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.450
You can count on me!

607
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.362
Oh, Abby, great. I need to borrow
your car. It's a work emergency.

608
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.523
I ride a bike, actually. It's good
exercise and good for the planet.

609
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.125
Just tell me where it is!

610
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.366
Dude, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

611
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.646
Have you heard about Philip Parker?

612
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.961
I don't wanna hear anything more
about his amazing party.

613
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.241
No. It's canceled.

614
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.967
What?

615
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.650
Yeah! He woke up with chicken pox.

616
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.085
He texted me this picture.

617
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.003
These things are everywhere.

618
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.086
Oh!

619
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.650
They're even in his butt crack.

620
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.006
So, his party's not on?

621
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.849
No! So everyone's coming
to yours again!

622
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.848
- Really?
- Great, right?

623
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.325
His pox is your gain.

624
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.481
Oh.

625
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.681
I gotta go. I gotta go.

626
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.161
Becky!

627
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.848
Becky, Becky. Wait, wait up.

628
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.361
Hi!

629
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.685
I am really sorry
about burning your binder yesterday.

630
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.927
Today's a new day,
and I thought that we could go ahead...

631
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.729
and sail our ships with positivity!

632
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.681
Wow, okay.

633
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.171
Anyway, Philip Parker has chicken pox.

634
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.486
But my party's still on.

635
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.811
So if you want to swing by,
it's gonna be pretty cool.

636
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.644
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

637
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.480
I actually feel bad Philip's gonna miss
such a sweet party, but...

638
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.409
what can you do when you got the pox?

639
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.042
Okay, maybe.

640
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.970
Fantastic! Maybe I'll see you later then.

641
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.042
Okay. See you.

642
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.361
See you!

643
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.960
No.

644
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.291
Should I put more over here?

645
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.204
Hey, birthday boy!

646
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.571
<i>Nothing goofy, Dad.</i>

647
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.080
- What? Alexander?
- Yeah...

648
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.010
and we're gonna need enough food,
cake and drinks for 50 kids.

649
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.367
- Everyone's coming.
- Okay, okay. Hold on. Now hold on.

650
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.731
What are you talking about?

651
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.410
<i>Philip Parker has chicken pox.</i>

652
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.090
<i>- The Party's on!
- Hey!</i>

653
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.804
That's fantastic. I mean, for you.

654
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.850
<i>Yeah. And guess what? Elliot got
busted for text-bombing the school.</i>

655
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.083
So I took your advice
and steered my ship with positivity.

656
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.288
And now Becky Gibson
might be coming, too.

657
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.771
<i>So no magic tricks.</i>

658
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.888
No tap dancing, nothing dorky.

659
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.365
<i>- You got it.
- I'm</i> turning <i>12.</i>

660
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.841
Got it. 12-year-old cool straight up.

661
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.320
- Do it right now.
- It's just allergies.

662
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.441
Really?

663
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.925
Hey, Em. What's up?

664
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.523
They're making me miss dress rehearsal
to lay down in the infirmary.

665
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.443
Oh! And Anthony called me.

666
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.443
Celia broke up with him.

667
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.811
They're going to prom tonight.

668
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.930
Apparently not anymore.

669
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.600
Can I be excused?

670
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.361
Yes.

671
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.966
What?

672
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.485
Listen...

673
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.284
I am sorry about last night.
You have to believe me.

674
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.163
I would never say
those things about you.

675
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.484
And tonight, I'm going
to make it up to you.

676
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.486
X-O-X-O.

677
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.001
I heart you.

678
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.642
Look, I just want
everything to be perfect tonight.

679
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.965
Please...

680
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.331
be my date for the prom.

681
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.646
This isn't <i>Gossip Girl,</i> you two.

682
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.761
Get back inside, Celia.

683
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.686
See you tonight.

684
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.641
Yes!

685
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.325
<i>Let's go, Wreck-It Ralph.</i>

686
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.522
Principal's office now!

687
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.364
Are you sure I can't just
drop him off with you?

688
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.004
Honey,
there's no way. Not today.

689
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.690
<i>What happened to the babysitter?</i>

690
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.404
Oh, she had to cancel again.

691
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.528
You know what? It's okay.
I'll just take him with me.

692
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.085
<i>You're taking Trevor to the interview?</i>

693
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.207
Yeah, I'll be fine.

694
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.004
<i>How's he doing without Bumble Bee?</i>

695
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.883
Um, he is...

696
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.048
He is hanging in there.
He's doing okay.

697
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.248
<i>Okay, honey.
I gotta go. I gotta go. Good luck!</i>

698
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.401
Thanks, you too, hon.

699
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.727
Hey, Anthony, what's up?

700
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.404
<i>Dad, I broke a trophy case
and got suspended.</i>

701
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.403
<i>- What?
- You have to come and pick me up.</i>

702
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.044
No! You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.440
<i>They say you need to come get me.</i>

704
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.289
No, no. You're gonna
have to wait at the Principal's

705
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.725
office till I'm done with my interview.

706
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.841
<i>Fine, I'll be here.</i>

707
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.211
Okay, bye.

708
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.807
On your left! I'm on your right!

709
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.964
On your right. On your left.

710
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.687
Are you okay?

711
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.761
I'm good. I got it!

712
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.610
I'm good. Don't worry!

713
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.881
Excuse me.

714
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.809
Mr. Van Dyke. Mr. Van Dyke!

715
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.280
I have been trying to reach you
because I'm here to save you.

716
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.249
I'm from the publishing company.

717
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.442
Let me start again. I'm not crazy.

718
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.567
Please welcome
legendary performer...

719
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.886
- No, no.
- That's my cue.

720
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.763
We'll have a little chat later, all right?

721
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.723
This is not something we should
leave until afterwards.

722
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.205
We wanna have
a chat right now, Mr. Van Dyke!

723
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.567
Please welcome Mr. Dick Van Dyke!

724
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.806
Please!

725
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.171
I insist that you get him.

726
00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.924
And I insist you stay right there.

727
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.961
- Hi, kids!
- Sir!

728
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.280
And hi, moms and dads.

729
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.328
There was a misprint! Just two minutes!

730
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.482
If you guys don't know who I am,
ask your parents.

731
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.521
And if they don't know...

732
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.840
have them ask their parents.

733
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.811
We're gonna have a great time today.

734
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.882
- I'm gonna read to you.
- You're not gonna want to say-!

735
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.201
I'm gonna read from a very special book.

736
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.281
You ready?

737
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.049
Get out of my way. I need him. Sir!

738
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.528
"Today's the day. You're growing up!

739
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.965
"I'm here to help you...

740
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.411
take that dump!"

741
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.005
Please don't, sir!

742
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.804
"Take that dump in the pool!

743
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.764
"Take that dump on the bed!

744
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.445
"But, don't take a dump on your,
on your brother's head.

745
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.323
"You can take a dump like a frog.

746
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.488
"I'll take a big dump like a dog!"

747
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.685
No! It's "jump"!

748
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.041
It's just jump, sir. Not dump.

749
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.801
Would you excuse me for a moment?

750
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.001
I never agreed to do this kind of...

751
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.320
There was a misprint.

752
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.250
Jump like a frog. One little letter.

753
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.328
It was a mistake!
It was meant to be jump! I'm so sorry.

754
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.011
There she is, right there,
with the bad hair! She's behind this.

755
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.326
Okay, we got this. We got this, right?

756
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.681
You good? You cool? You ready?

757
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.047
You ready to nail this? All right.

758
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.403
Oh, wow!

759
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.731
Hey, man, guys are ready for you.

760
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.962
- Let's go.
- Oh, great, thank you.

761
00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.086
At first we thought it was a little weird

762
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.247
that you even applied for this job...

763
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.767
because we're pretty young and you're...

764
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.241
Older.

765
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.367
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

766
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.481
Kind of decrepit.

767
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.480
But then we took a look at your resume,

768
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.931
and your experience is awesome.

769
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.722
You're part of
the space station design team.

770
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.889
You have a Ph.D.
in orbital mechanics. I mean, for real?

771
00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.921
For real.

772
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.361
Sorry.

773
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.371
Hey, you.

774
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.208
He's a little out of sorts today.

775
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.082
It's so hard
to find the Bumble Bee pacifier.

776
00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.203
It would blow your mind. Anyway...

777
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.765
Here you go.

778
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.689
He's just gonna play for a while.

779
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.127
And, kids are crazy.

780
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.761
They're fun.

781
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.841
Yeah.

782
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.649
So, what were we talking about?

783
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.290
We're thinking about
launching this game.

784
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.608
We want it to be a space station
simulation strategy game.

785
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.644
We want it to be authentic
and completely immersive.

786
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.563
That sounds really exciting.

787
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.090
That's in my wheelhouse.

788
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.690
Great! We wanna hear some ideas.

789
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.848
I guess my first idea would
be modular evolution.

790
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.251
Cool.

791
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.567
Space stations are not static.
They grow over time.

792
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.008
So you would want to start with
perhaps a small space station...

793
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.447
and grow it into
an enormous space station.

794
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.761
And I think players
should have that opportunity.

795
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.689
They could add greenhouses.

796
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.171
They could add labs.

797
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.765
They could grow a space station...

798
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.329
as big as their imagination.

799
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.961
- Uh... Your kid.
- Oh!

800
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.644
You know what, that'll be fine.

801
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.967
Because we can get daycare,
so that won't be an issue.

802
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.485
No, no, no.

803
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.521
Your kid right now...

804
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.523
his face is all green.

805
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.682
Oh! Wow, Trev.

806
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.011
Trevor. I know.

807
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.721
That's not for eating.

808
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.171
Yoshi, what's up, man?

809
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.089
<i>Good news to report or what?</i>

810
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.925
Actually, we have
a Skype call we gotta take.

811
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.365
But we will call you back.

812
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.571
Okay. You'll call me back?

813
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.161
- Yeah.
- All right.

814
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.683
Great. All right, we'll head out.

815
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.886
You ready to go?

816
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.281
Anthony,

817
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.682
of all the days for you to get sent home,
it had to be today?

818
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.046
Dad, it was a freak accident!

819
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.360
Don't!

820
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.566
What happened to Trevor?

821
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.361
That's real mature, Dad.

822
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.441
Hey, Salamander.

823
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.686
Hey, Dad!

824
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.048
Whoa! What happened to Trevor?

825
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.521
He ate a delicious
green marker for lunch.

826
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.568
- Why are you here?
- Shut up.

827
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.688
Em, I thought you had to stay
to get ready for your play.

828
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.721
I need drugs.

829
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.326
Real drugs. The nurse will
only give me baby aspirin.

830
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.731
What happened to Trevor?

831
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.445
Emily, we're not gonna pump you
full of medicine. You're not a cyclist.

832
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.444
I'm not asking for steroids.
I need cough syrup, something.

833
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.409
Wait, Dad! How was your interview?

834
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.240
It was not a good fit.

835
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.450
But, you know? We'll see what happens.

836
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.641
It was fine.

837
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.721
Try again next time.

838
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.801
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Brand.

839
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.167
I know she's not 100%, but...

840
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.402
as they say, the show must go on.

841
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.482
So, if you could get her back here
by 3:00 for hair and makeup...

842
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.561
that would be tremendous.

843
00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.081
Em, you look terrible.

844
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.525
Maybe you should have
your understudy do it?

845
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.007
No! Nobody wears
those tights but me. Pharmacy, pronto!

846
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.610
Nobody wears the tights but her.

847
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.611
<i>Any available cashier to register two.</i>

848
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.250
Extra strength or regular?

849
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.924
What do you think?

850
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.610
Excuse me. Do you have
a Bumble Bee pacifier?

851
00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.005
Does it have to be Bumble Bee?

852
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.081
It has to be the Bumble Bee.

853
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.531
Yes, because this ain't gonna last.

854
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.840
Thank you.

855
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.206
Hey, how'd the reading go?

856
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.840
<i>It could've gone better.</i>

857
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.770
<i>Honey, I'm sure it was great.</i>

858
00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.921
Uh, well...

859
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.241
<i>Well, you know what,
I'm sure it was not that bad, really.</i>

860
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.248
That girl with the awful hair, I think.

861
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.921
No, no. I thought, maybe... No, it's bad.

862
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.291
<i>It was bad. It was lose-my-job bad.</i>

863
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.685
Really?

864
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.650
Anthony, come on! No, please. Stop it.

865
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.125
- No, I'm just...
- Stop it!

866
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.810
What are you doing?
Why is Anthony with you?

867
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.325
He was suspended from school...

868
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.885
<i>for destroying school property.</i>

869
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.123
- What? What happened?
- It's fine.

870
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.525
It was an accident.
I'll tell you about it later.

871
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.080
Okay, so, Em is getting her cough syrup.

872
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.770
I'm taking Anthony to his driver's test.

873
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.484
And, good news!

874
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.807
50 kids are coming over tonight.
The party is on!

875
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.841
<i>Boy, this is...</i>

876
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.645
- Maybe I should meet you. I'm not far.
<i>- It's</i> fine!

877
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.445
Hon, I'm totally... Hold on.

878
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.323
No, we don't have one.

879
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.203
Daddy wishes he could swear right now.

880
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.047
Hey, question.

881
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.049
Permanent marker,
do you know if it's poisonous?

882
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.560
Because he might have ingested some.

883
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.841
What?

884
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.450
<i>- Ben!</i>
- Honey, honey...

885
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.686
- I'm coming!
- No, no, no! I'm good.

886
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.125
Tell Trevor Mama's on her way!

887
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.045
Nobody's home.

888
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.246
Call 'em, dude.

889
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.688
Anthony, are you sure
you're up for this today?

890
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.967
Dad, it's now or never.
I promised Celia.

891
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.368
All right. Well, anything worth
doing is worth doing well.

892
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.320
Try not to kill anybody.

893
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.165
Hello. Yeah.

894
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.364
I'm not gonna be back
for a while, so, the gate's open.

895
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.050
Just go in, start setting everything up.

896
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.366
<i>Are you sure you guys can handle this?</i>

897
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.204
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
We'll be ready to party.

898
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.241
<i>Okay-</i>

899
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.560
- Okay, great.
- See you later.

900
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.681
Thanks.

901
00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.567
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

902
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.568
Emily, just the recommended
dosage, please.

903
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.720
That stuff's pretty strong.

904
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.561
Hi, guys.

905
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.880
Hey, there's Mama.

906
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.046
Why is my baby green?

907
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.411
Well, things went a little awry today.

908
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.441
Honey.

909
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.521
- Look who it is.
- Ben, he's green.

910
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.561
- I know.
- What is this?

911
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.723
It's marker. It's fine.
How did it go? How was the reading?

912
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.570
It was awful. I think I pretty much
flushed my career down the potty.

913
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.721
Why, what happened?

914
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.444
Never mind. Can I have the wipes?

915
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.249
- Dad!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

916
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.243
I told you this day was cursed.

917
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.281
Sorry.

918
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.601
Cooper. Anthony Cooper.

919
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.727
- All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck, baby.

920
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.922
<i>- Here you go.
- Anthony Cooper.</i>

921
00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.121
Wait, Anthony!

922
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.564
Please don't do it today.
You're gonna fail.

923
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.726
Alexander...

924
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.091
give your brother some space, please.

925
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.407
Yeah, the next time you see this face,
it's gonna be on my driver's license.

926
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.521
It's not coming off.

927
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.931
Just hurry up! I need to get to my play.

928
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.961
What kind of a person...

929
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.087
It's not poisonous.

930
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.890
I don't think it's poisonous.

931
00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.446
Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm really excited...

932
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.130
There are only two things
you need to know.

933
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.130
My name is Ms. Suggs
and I'll be your driving examiner.

934
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.050
Now, you may be
the big man on campus out there...

935
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.441
but in this minivan, I'm the B.M.O.C.

936
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.965
You get me?

937
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.925
Now put your hands at 10 and 2,
and show me what you can do.

938
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.528
Hi, Mom, how you doing?

939
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.123
How's your day going so far?

940
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.128
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- What?

941
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.288
Just make this little call.

942
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.401
Okay.

943
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.085
Yeah, it's...

944
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.602
Cooper! Where are you?

945
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.802
<i>My family had a little situation, so...</i>

946
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.649
Really? That's funny.

947
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.650
Because we're having
a little bit of a situation here!

948
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.326
<i>The phones are going crazy.</i>

949
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.004
What happened at that reading?

950
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.010
Well, it was a really good crowd.

951
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.764
It was a big, big crowd. Big turnout.

952
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.850
And the parents seemed
to have a lot to say.

953
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.161
- They responded.
<i>- Did they?</i>

954
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.886
Did they respond
to Dick Van Dyke asking their toddlers...

955
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.928
if they could take a dump like a dog?

956
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.488
<i>I thought I could count on you.</i>

957
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.204
We'll discuss this later.

958
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.048
I look forward to...
I look forward to that.

959
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.005
Tell me something, Anthony.
Are you a senior citizen?

960
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.011
No, ma'am.

961
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.681
Well, then why are you driving
15 miles an hour in a 25 mile zone?

962
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.761
Come on, speed it up.

963
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.761
That's right. That is right. Boy.

964
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.562
Change lanes.

965
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.120
Now, I want you to take a right up here.

966
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.362
All right. Okay.

967
00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.725
Celia's calling.

968
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.246
It's my girlfriend.
Probably wants to talk prom plans.

969
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.086
Tonight's the prom.
Well, I'll just ignore that.

970
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.610
It seems like
she's very anxious to talk to you.

971
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.090
No. No, no. I'm driving.

972
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.242
I would never answer
the phone when I'm driving.

973
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.481
No.

974
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.680
No matter what circumstance.

975
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.166
But, you know,
proms don't happen every day.

976
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.287
That's true.

977
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.568
You sure?
It'll just be super quick. It's not...

978
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.883
What's important to you
is important to me.

979
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.401
Right?

980
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.128
Hey, Celia.
I can't really talk right now, but...

981
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.090
- Put the phone down!
- What?

982
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.521
Put the mobile device down now!

983
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.681
Hey, eyes on the road!

984
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.091
No, no!

985
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.451
You're gonna kill us!

986
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.647
What is wrong with you?

987
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.046
What are you doing?

988
00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:03.250
What are you...
What are you doing? You fool!

989
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.125
You tricked me!

990
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.606
Get outta this car.

991
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.806
- You get out of this car.
- You're evil!

992
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.291
You prom creep!

993
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.482
- I don't think he passed.
- Get out!

994
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.521
Get out!

995
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.286
This is your fault.

996
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.444
If you hadn't caused a fight
between me and Celia...

997
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.481
I would've never picked up that call...

998
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.641
- and failed my test.
- No, no, no.

999
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.001
Anthony, you are
not passing the blame on this one.

1000
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.486
I told you today might not be a good day
to take the test.

1001
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.851
Dad, I had to take the test today.

1002
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.006
No, you didn't have
to take the test today.

1003
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.570
It is all Alexander's fault.

1004
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.688
If he hadn't dropped Trevor's
paci down the disposal...

1005
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.371
I never would have
rehearsed in a cold car and gotten sick.

1006
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.481
That's also your fault.

1007
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.409
If you hadn't
left the battery on in my car all night...

1008
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.481
I wouldn't have been late to work...

1009
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.170
and Dick Van Dyke
wouldn't be mad at me.

1010
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.646
Chim Chiminey wants to kill me!
Can you imagine?

1011
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.604
Mom, Trevor was crying!
Where was I supposed to rehearse?

1012
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.002
How were you able
to hit every parking meter on that street?

1013
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.724
When I was in the bathroom
this morning, Mom saw me naked!

1014
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.723
I don't think you left a speck of paint!

1015
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.121
Her fault!
She's an evil woman.

1016
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.771
Boom, boom, boom,
one right after the other.

1017
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.211
Stop, you guys!

1018
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.451
Okay, stop!

1019
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.524
It was my fault.

1020
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.803
I'm to blame for all of it. For everything.

1021
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.291
Yeah, see? I told you.

1022
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.964
No, hold on, hold on.

1023
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.281
Alexander, what are you saying?

1024
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.361
Okay, look.

1025
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.846
Last night I made
myself a birthday sundae

1026
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.450
and I made a wish on a candle...

1027
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.808
and I think I cursed this day
for all of you.

1028
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.530
- You did what?
- I'm sorry.

1029
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.846
I just wanted you guys
to know what it was like...

1030
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.724
to have a massively
horrible, terrible day.

1031
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.569
So I wished it...

1032
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.244
and now you're all having one.

1033
00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.361
Alexander,
as incredible as it would be...

1034
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.482
for you to have
that kind of supernatural ability...

1035
00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.766
I don't think you can
actually curse a day, buddy.

1036
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.047
Yeah, sweetie,
this isn't your fault.

1037
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.366
We just bit off
more than we could chew today...

1038
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.561
and it isn't going our way.

1039
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.364
No, look, I did curse the day.

1040
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.880
I don't know how,
but I did, and it worked.

1041
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.570
And now Emily's gonna miss her play...

1042
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.251
and Anthony's not gonna be
able to drive Celia to the prom.

1043
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.566
He's been waiting all year to make out
with her in the back of the van.

1044
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.364
Okay, we don't need to hear that.

1045
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.004
Okay, I'm sorry.

1046
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.404
I'm really sorry.

1047
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.761
Just forget my party.

1048
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.723
It'll be a disaster anyway.

1049
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.130
Apology not accepted.

1050
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.441
Look...

1051
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.450
this day is not ruined,
because this day is not over yet.

1052
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.845
Dad, you're so right.

1053
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.123
I may be sick, but there's no way
I'm missing opening night.

1054
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.446
I may have wrecked the van...

1055
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.324
but I'm not missing prom
with Celia. I can't.

1056
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.325
Look, we are not
going to let this day get the better of us.

1057
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.283
It's like last week at Target
when Dad lost Trevor for 45 minutes.

1058
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.446
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1059
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.244
And the store manager
wanted to call the cops...

1060
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.282
but Dad said, "No!"

1061
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.970
- We found him.
- "We are gonna keep looking."

1062
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.041
We will keep looking for my baby?

1063
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.281
"We will find my baby."

1064
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.646
They sealed the doors. It was fine.

1065
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.648
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1066
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.806
Okay, guys, okay.

1067
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.803
It's past 3:00, so if we're gonna go,
we gotta do this now.

1068
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.001
Are we ready, Coopers?

1069
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.321
All right! Clap those hands
if you believe in fairies!

1070
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.970
Emily, are you okay?

1071
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.289
Mom! Positivism. Let's do this thing.

1072
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.765
Get in there, get in there.

1073
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.689
- Buckle, buckle!
- Buckle, buckle!

1074
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.651
Go, go, go, go, go!

1075
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.291
It seems we may
have accidentally given your tux away.

1076
00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.401
Well, get it back.

1077
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.482
Sir, I cannot un-tux a client.

1078
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.682
My sister's Peter Pan
and we've got 10 minutes till curtain.

1079
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.484
You better un-tux something.

1080
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.206
There is one option.
You might be able to pull it off.

1081
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.880
All right, fire up. Come on, let's go.

1082
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.206
Coopers on the move!

1083
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.361
We got it.

1084
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.244
All right. Anthony, find a seat.

1085
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.521
Break a leg, Em.

1086
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.727
I'm here!

1087
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.921
Get some more of this.

1088
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.001
Honey? Hon, hon.

1089
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.282
Em. Em. Sweetie,
I think you've had plenty of that.

1090
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.680
It's okay, honey.

1091
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.529
- Peter Pan is here, everybody!
- Excuse me, people.

1092
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.881
- Everybody, Peter's here!
- Excuse us, excuse us.

1093
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.961
- You look so pretty.
- Superstar coming through.

1094
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.041
Superstar

1095
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.570
Excuse me, everyone.

1096
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.601
All right.

1097
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.210
I love your outfit.

1098
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.801
Okay.

1099
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.051
I said 3:00.

1100
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.560
You have no idea
the kind of day we are having.

1101
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.680
It's a miracle we're here.

1102
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.840
Well, you're late,
which is not professional behavior.

1103
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.564
No! And it's not professional...

1104
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.568
because this is an eighth grade
production of <i>Peter</i> Pan.

1105
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.450
And if you could take
one look at our minivan...

1106
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.284
Mr. Brand, I am not somebody

1107
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.328
that you wanna mess with right now.

1108
00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.965
So grab her some green tights
and a harness...

1109
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.280
and fire up her Tinker Bell!

1110
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.169
As soon as you
have your costumes on...

1111
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.446
go for your hair.

1112
00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.726
Way to go, Daddy-O!

1113
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.285
- Break a leg, sweetie.
- Good luck!

1114
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.880
Show's about to start, Emily.
We've got to get you going.

1115
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.924
Everything's under control.
Yeah. You okay?

1116
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.286
Yeah.

1117
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.329
- I'm excited about this.
- Yeah.

1118
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.447
It's gonna be great.

1119
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.521
Yeah, I think so.

1120
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.967
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Father.

1121
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.044
Now, you two be quiet
and I'll tell you a story.

1122
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.804
What sort of story?

1123
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.205
The best sort.

1124
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.727
One filled with
magic and fairies and savage pirates...

1125
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.131
called Never Never Land.

1126
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.605
Hi, hello!

1127
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.126
Whoa! No!

1128
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.682
I'm a little boy
named Peter Pan!

1129
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.490
- Hello! How are you?
- What's wrong with her?

1130
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.641
It must be the cough syrup.

1131
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.324
So good to see you.

1132
00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.648
Peter Pan is in the house!

1133
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.640
<i>Think of</i> a <i>wonderful thought</i>

1134
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.960
Get the hook and get her down!

1135
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.320
<i>Any merry little thought</i>

1136
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.442
- Oh, no!
- Hook her down! Hook her!

1137
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.641
I'm floating. I'm floating.

1138
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.681
Get her!

1139
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.647
<i>Reindeer in the sky</i>

1140
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.844
<i>Let go!</i>

1141
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.724
- Get her down!
- Let go of me!

1142
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.480
Let go of me right now!

1143
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.241
<i>Let go!</i>

1144
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.681
<i>Everybody, fly!</i>

1145
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.200
She's okay. She's all right. There she is.

1146
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.280
Ta-da!

1147
00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.127
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

1148
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.680
Oh, my God, Josephine, hi!

1149
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.290
Daniel, hi!

1150
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.842
Hi! Hello, everybody.
Take some pixie dust!

1151
00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.205
Thank you, thank you!

1152
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.042
How much cough syrup did she have?

1153
00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.048
Clearly, way too much.

1154
00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.366
There she is.

1155
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.210
- Hi!
- Hey, honey.

1156
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.761
Wow.

1157
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.410
Well, that was
an incredible thing to watch.

1158
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.205
I think I broke Captain Hook's nose.

1159
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.487
Sweetie, it's not your fault.

1160
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.291
We shouldn't have let
you go out there today.

1161
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.567
No, you can't fool around
with medicine, hon.

1162
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.721
Emily. Emily.

1163
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.762
Dude, you crushed it!

1164
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.808
I gotta change into my tux.

1165
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.648
- Mr. Brand?
- Not now.

1166
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.760
Can't speak.

1167
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.246
Honey, it's all going
to be okay. Trust me.

1168
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.761
Love you, Dad.

1169
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.760
Love you, too.

1170
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:53.128
Okay, sweetie.
Okay, honey. That felt good.

1171
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.246
You get that out.

1172
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.446
Let's go outside and get you some air.

1173
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.845
I'm sorry.

1174
00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.570
No, honey, it's fine.

1175
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.090
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1176
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.842
- When did she start eating carrots?
- Uh...

1177
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:12.047
Your sister has excellent aim.

1178
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.161
Can I have another towel?

1179
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.170
Thanks. Oh, man.

1180
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.280
Hello?

1181
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.486
Hey, Greg.

1182
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.644
No, now's a fine time.

1183
00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.880
You did?

1184
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.644
No, I'm not surprised.
I thought it was a killer interview also.

1185
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.041
Uh-huh.

1186
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.284
You wanna meet? Okay.

1187
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.328
Well, now actually
isn't a really good time.

1188
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.283
No. No, no, no.

1189
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.731
- Go, go, go!
- Drinks at Nagamaki?

1190
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.404
- Go!
- Could you hold on a second, Greg?

1191
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.482
Alexander, I appreciate
what you're trying to do...

1192
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.124
but our plate is full.

1193
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.288
We got too much
going on tonight, kiddo.

1194
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.482
Dad, curse or no curse...

1195
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.045
just go for it!

1196
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.001
Greg, we're gonna go for it.

1197
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.486
Yeah, I will see you
at Nagamaki later, okay?

1198
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.088
Okay. Good. I look forward to it.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

1199
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.161
Awesome!

1200
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.680
Okay. I reek.

1201
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.803
You do. Oh, look. Wait.

1202
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.251
This looks like your size.

1203
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.482
I'm not going to wear a pirate blouse.

1204
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.285
Pirate or puke, your choice.

1205
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.690
It's okay, Em.

1206
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.360
It took a lot of courage
to fly out on that stage tonight.

1207
00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.691
Do you have any idea
how proud we are of you?

1208
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.202
You've always just
put yourself out there.

1209
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.124
You are fearless.

1210
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.962
You're willing
to show the world who you really are.

1211
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.883
That's amazing.

1212
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.328
But if you're ever
about to take the stage on Broadway...

1213
00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.489
and you decide to drink
a bottle of cough syrup, give me a call.

1214
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.891
Let me talk you out of it.

1215
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.409
Ladies, care to do some pillaging?

1216
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.804
Okay. All right.

1217
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.364
All right, how did I end up blue?

1218
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.686
Celia's gonna love it.

1219
00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.205
It's totally retro.

1220
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.241
Just own it, kiddo.

1221
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.125
You look ridiculous.

1222
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.923
Go get your Duchess, Duke.

1223
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.610
My little boy...

1224
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.329
in a tuxedo, going to prom...

1225
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.124
in sneakers.

1226
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.007
Wow. You look amazing.

1227
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.649
What are you wearing?
You look like Willy Wonka.

1228
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.931
I'm trying something different.

1229
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.331
What's going on?

1230
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.284
Oh...

1231
00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.527
Yeah, I kind of failed my driver's test.

1232
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.321
Oops.

1233
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.851
You look beautiful, Celia.

1234
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.965
'Course I do.

1235
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.206
Yeah, that's a sick dress.

1236
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.521
I hope this isn't
too much wind for you, Celia.

1237
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.881
It's actually helping
with the vomit smell.

1238
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.490
So is everybody hungry?

1239
00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.329
- I am.
- I am.

1240
00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.441
They're coming to dinner?

1241
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.522
Don't worry.
They're not gonna sit at our table.

1242
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.645
- How about some music?
- Yes. Yes.

1243
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.241
Oh.

1244
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.327
No surprise, the radio's broken.

1245
00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.404
This is just something
that we do for fun sometimes.

1246
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.724
Figured it'd make you laugh.

1247
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.890
We're going to Nagamaki!

1248
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.684
What? Are you kidding me?

1249
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.762
- Nagamaki!
- They cook it on the table.

1250
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.370
They cook it right on the table.

1251
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.925
Like a fondue, but not.

1252
00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.041
Supposed to be
a very authentic Japanese restaurant.

1253
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.366
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

1254
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.601
Thank you.

1255
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.287
Konnichiwa. Welcome to Nagamaki!

1256
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.441
Table for two, please.

1257
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.601
Right this way.

1258
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.561
There they are.

1259
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.001
You okay?

1260
00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.281
Yeah.

1261
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.365
Honey, come on.
Ben, you're the smartest guy I know.

1262
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.966
You're literally a rocket scientist.
You've got these guys.

1263
00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.930
Is it better tucked in?

1264
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.564
You hesitated. Here we go.

1265
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.130
- Go get them, buccaneer.
- Thanks. Bye.

1266
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.527
- Good luck.
- Good luck, good luck.

1267
00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:11.641
Hey, fellas.

1268
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.329
Is that a pirate's blouse?

1269
00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.441
Yaar!

1270
00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.890
Yes, it be!

1271
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.121
Yaar-some!

1272
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.329
Climb aboard, matey!

1273
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.241
How's he doing?

1274
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.685
He looks like he's having fun.

1275
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.761
He does?

1276
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.086
They look impressed.

1277
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.321
Oh, good.

1278
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.643
That is exactly what I am talking about.
You have multi-players...

1279
00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.285
<i>Survivor-style.</i>

1280
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.810
It's Survivor on a space station.

1281
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.080
That's so cool. Multi-player.
What do you think?

1282
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.650
- Yoshi's gonna flip.
- It would be sick.

1283
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.841
To Ben.

1284
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.566
The space pirates.

1285
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.880
- Space pirates.
- Space pirate.

1286
00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.368
Are you sure you're not adopted?

1287
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.842
You should try a shrimp.
They're really good.

1288
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.041
I'm allergic to shrimp.

1289
01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.002
You should know
what your girlfriend's allergic to.

1290
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.326
Yeah, sorry.

1291
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.886
X-O-X-O?

1292
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.528
Anthony, I just can't believe, on the most
important night of our lives...

1293
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.881
you brought me to a place
where I have to watch my food...

1294
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.450
get cooked in front of me.

1295
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.170
Who goes to Nagamaki
before the prom?

1296
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.570
It's so amazing, okay?

1297
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.047
Look! It's Hope and Dale
and Heather and Dave!

1298
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.088
Hey, guys-.

1299
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.924
Hey, Celia. What's up, Anthony?

1300
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.050
O-M-G! You look beautiful.

1301
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.610
- Love it.
- Thanks.

1302
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.409
Don't you guys just love this place?

1303
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.766
Totally. I die for it.

1304
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.044
Oh, my God, me too.
I'll catch you guys later?

1305
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.201
Okay.

1306
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.601
Space pirate!
Space pirate! Space pirate!

1307
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.369
Sake bomb!

1308
01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.604
It sounds like it couldn't be going better.

1309
01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.367
Chef Ananda! Shrimp me.

1310
01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.561
Oh!

1311
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.361
You ready?

1312
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.606
Yeah, I'm ready.

1313
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.006
One! That was one.

1314
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.761
Yeah!

1315
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.841
Fire it up!

1316
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.561
Three!

1317
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.081
Four!

1318
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.161
Keep it going.

1319
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.761
Five!

1320
01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.561
Six!

1321
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.801
Seven!

1322
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.761
Eight!

1323
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.086
Nine!

1324
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.121
Ten!

1325
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.366
Mom, Dad's on fire!

1326
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.441
<i>I</i> hope so!

1327
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.084
No, no, no. He's really on fire!

1328
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.890
Drop and roll, Ben. Drop and roll.

1329
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.161
Drop and roll!

1330
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.001
Stop, drop and roll, honey.

1331
01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.081
Dad?

1332
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.645
I still have me arms!

1333
01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.731
Thank you for your time.

1334
01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.648
Nice job, you really nailed it.
Really nailed it, Ben!

1335
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.241
You know who you are?
You're the flaming pirate of Nagamaki!

1336
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.650
- Thank you!
- Whoa!

1337
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.724
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

1338
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.441
Are you okay?

1339
01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.445
Yeah! I'm good.

1340
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.690
I'm fine.

1341
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.281
It's all good.

1342
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.241
It's all good.

1343
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.201
Dad...

1344
01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.722
you don't always
have to steer your ship with positivity!

1345
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.161
You keep us up
and we really appreciate it.

1346
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.487
But some days are just bad.

1347
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.925
Nothing can fix it.

1348
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.041
Trust me.

1349
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.847
I would know.

1350
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.490
At least we're all together now.

1351
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.484
It's my job to take care of you guys.

1352
01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.924
And, make sure
you don't have bad days.

1353
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.131
- And when you do, it's on me!
- Ben.

1354
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.801
I think that you just...

1355
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.569
got to have the bad days so you can
love the good days even more.

1356
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.408
This day has been terrible!

1357
01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.761
Terrible day.

1358
01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.250
Yeah! A horrible day!

1359
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.806
A no-good...

1360
01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.526
Very bad day!

1361
01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.885
You know what I think?

1362
01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.405
I think this day sucks!

1363
01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.487
Yes! It does.

1364
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.561
Thank you!

1365
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.090
I love you guys.

1366
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.121
Come here.

1367
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.886
Ow!

1368
01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.326
Can't breathe!

1369
01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.364
- You sure?
- Yeah, totally. Come with us.

1370
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.569
Okay, cool. All right, so, good news.
They have room...

1371
01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.080
and they said we could go with them.

1372
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.926
Uh...

1373
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.041
I don't know.

1374
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.640
What do you mean, you don't know?

1375
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.369
We're not going in some busted-up
minivan with your crazy family.

1376
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.240
You know what, go without me.

1377
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.561
Excuse me?

1378
01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.207
You want me to go
to the prom without you?

1379
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.688
Yes. That's what I want.

1380
01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.845
I'm sticking with my family tonight.

1381
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.807
You're choosing them over me?

1382
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.043
Yes, Celia. I am.

1383
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.326
Because they're my family.

1384
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.641
And if they're crazy,
then I guess it makes me crazy, too.

1385
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.530
Have fun at the prom, Duchess.

1386
01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.491
What are you doing?

1387
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.570
Forget it.

1388
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.051
So, what? No prom?

1389
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.121
It's junior prom. The real one's next year.

1390
01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.130
What about Celia?

1391
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.651
I realized there's
more important things than Celia.

1392
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.842
- You sure?
- Very.

1393
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.281
Good to have you on board.

1394
01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.361
Thanks, Dad.

1395
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.607
What was that for?

1396
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.520
I didn't wish you happy birthday yet.

1397
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.805
<i>When there's</i>
a <i>smile in your heart</i>

1398
01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.804
<i>There's no better way to start</i>

1399
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.646
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

1400
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.041
<i>When you leave your past behind</i>

1401
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.561
How did he get in there?

1402
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.886
It's okay.

1403
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.240
Dad, be careful.

1404
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.850
There it goes.

1405
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.406
It's okay.

1406
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.566
Stay behind me.

1407
01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.680
Wow.

1408
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.329
Guys, there is a kangaroo out there.

1409
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.321
And an emu.

1410
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.284
And a cockatoo.

1411
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.364
And a wallaby.

1412
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.929
Wow,
you really know your animals.

1413
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.201
Yeah, they're all Australian.
What's going on?

1414
01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.886
I don't think they were
meant to be presented in quite this way.

1415
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.166
- No.
- Hi!

1416
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.086
You must be the Coopers.

1417
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.643
Hey, yeah!
This was supposed to be a petting zoo?

1418
01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.887
A confined Australian petting zoo.

1419
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.846
Yeah, it is. One of the pens was
open and the kangaroo got out.

1420
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.570
Oh, yeah, the kangaroo.

1421
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.688
There was also a crocodile
in our entry hall.

1422
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.244
So sorry about that.

1423
01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.448
We had him in the pool,
and we got distracted.

1424
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.801
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll put him back in the pen.

1425
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.330
Okay, you got him from here on out?

1426
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.169
- Yeah!
- Okay, great. Thanks.

1427
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.326
We got you, Mr. Cooper.

1428
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.205
- It'll be fine, right?
- Yeah.

1429
01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.645
- I don't think he's gonna get out again.
- No.

1430
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.484
You guys did all of this for me?

1431
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.527
Yeah! Your mom and I thought you
might enjoy a night in the Outback.

1432
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.011
You can pet him if you want.

1433
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.407
His name's Winston.

1434
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.121
Hello, Winston.

1435
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.851
This is amazing.

1436
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.365
Okay, guys?
We've got guests coming any minute.

1437
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.890
So here's what we have to do.

1438
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.611
Emily, you're on music.
Anthony, fire up the barbie.

1439
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.409
Mom, snacks.

1440
01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.970
Alexander, why don't
you help Mom keep

1441
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.650
Trevor away from
anything that will eat him?

1442
01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.603
Baby safety. 10-4.

1443
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.205
I think we're all good now.

1444
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.366
Super Coopers!

1445
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.401
Super Coopers!

1446
01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.209
Lenny! Get back here.

1447
01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.486
Lenny! Someone get him!

1448
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.570
- I am on it!
- Ben!

1449
01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.051
Lenny!

1450
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.206
- Ben!
- Dad?

1451
01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.341
Lenny!

1452
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.081
Okay!

1453
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.245
That was pretty good!

1454
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.726
Where are you?

1455
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.966
Where are you?

1456
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.086
Hey!

1457
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.091
Hey there...

1458
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.765
Party kangaroo.

1459
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.801
I'm Ben...

1460
01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.722
and I want you to join me...

1461
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.966
back at the party.

1462
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.561
Yeah!

1463
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.965
Nice work, Mr. Cooper.

1464
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.087
Thank you, Dwayne.

1465
01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.929
Come here, Lenny. Here we go.

1466
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.651
What's up, man?

1467
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.520
Pretty cool, huh?

1468
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.329
This party's gonna be killer, dude.

1469
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.641
Hey, guys!

1470
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.090
Your dad is hardcore!

1471
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.685
Dude, did you see that?

1472
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.450
- Hey! Hey!
- G'day.

1473
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.244
You must be my Australian cowboys.

1474
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.129
- We sure are.
- Awesome!

1475
01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.891
Wow! You guys are in good shape.

1476
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.006
Hey, Nina, how are you?

1477
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.325
It's the video game guys!

1478
01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.920
Uh-huh.

1479
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.485
- Yeah.
- No, it's a great time to talk.

1480
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.524
No. Just a little bit of the hair
was singed.

1481
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.211
- Really?
- I know.

1482
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.685
I know that was a lot of shrimp!

1483
01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.761
Dude!

1484
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.241
Hey, you came!

1485
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.240
Happy birthday!

1486
01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.721
This looks amazing!

1487
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.490
Yeah, thanks.

1488
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.331
Look, this has been
a really, really crazy day.

1489
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.049
Looks like it turned out
pretty good to me.

1490
01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.401
Yeah.

1491
01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.651
Have a good weekend, Nina...

1492
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.926
Have a good weekend, Greg.

1493
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.764
- And thank you for everything.
- Thank you for your call.

1494
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.841
Thanks.

1495
01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.005
How are you? How was that call?

1496
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.530
It was great. I got the job!

1497
01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.486
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

1498
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.326
It's fantastic!

1499
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.289
They thought I was fun!

1500
01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.361
Even after you singed your arms...

1501
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.050
Even after the thing and the thing.

1502
01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.320
"I still have me arms"?

1503
01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.562
I was a fiery pirate! They loved it!

1504
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.201
Wow!

1505
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.170
You know what the best thing is?

1506
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.324
As long as I'm getting the work done...

1507
01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.129
I can make my own hours.

1508
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.090
I'll be able to still do carpool
and see the kids all the time.

1509
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.962
Wow, I am so happy for you.

1510
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.010
What about you?
What about your call? How did it go?

1511
01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.287
Dick Van Dyke's reading went viral.

1512
01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.885
500,000 hits today.

1513
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.605
You're kidding me.

1514
01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.483
Nina says the book
is gonna be huge.

1515
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.925
That is fantastic, sweetie!

1516
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.961
Yeah...

1517
01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.201
it's great!

1518
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.611
I cannot believe
we pulled this party off.

1519
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.129
We really turned this day around.

1520
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.001
What's that?

1521
01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.361
What are they doing?

1522
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.004
That's the Thunder from Down Under.

1523
01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.969
They're supposed to be
authentic Australian cowboys.

1524
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.001
They're not.

1525
01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.487
No, no, no!

1526
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.564
Guys? Guys, PG!

1527
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.971
PG! Keep it PG!

1528
01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.560
Please!

1529
01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.330
Oh, no.

1530
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.846
Go, Alex!
Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go, Alex!

1531
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:10.321
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

1532
01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.328
<i>After today, I know that...</i>

1533
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.362
<i>even terrible days aren't so bad</i>

1534
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.363
<i>when you're surrounded
by the people you love.</i>

1535
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.966
Make a wish, kiddo.

1536
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.201
<i>Because it turns out...</i>

1537
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.730
<i>the worse things</i> are...

1538
01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.410
<i>the better this family gets.</i>

1539
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.166
To more days like this.

1540
01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.361
No!

1541
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.323
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay.

1542
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.522
<i>For us, this bad</i> day...

1543
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.005
<i>was the best day ever!</i>
